This project simulates a dialogue between a **financial advisor** and a **client**, with support for **text-to-speech** or **transcription** functionality using the **OpenAI API**.

---

## 🎯 Project Description

The script:
- Defines a scripted financial conversation as a list of speaker turns.
- Can be extended to:
  - Transcribe audio files (.mp3/.wav)
  - Convert dialogue into audio using TTS APIs
  - Log and display conversation with speaker labels

---

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/transcribe_project.git
   cd transcribe_project
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Add your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
   ```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python transcribe.py
```

Make sure the script is configured with the desired speaker dialogue and any audio functionality you want to simulate.

## 📌 Use Cases

* 🧑‍💼 Simulating financial advisor conversations
* 🗣️ Converting scripts to speech (TTS)
* 📄 Generating labeled transcripts for NLP models
* 🧪 Prototyping conversational AI flows

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

* Add Whisper-based audio transcription
* Export transcripts to `.txt` or `.srt`
* Integrate Streamlit UI for easier input/output
* Support for role-based audio generation (multi-speaker voices)
