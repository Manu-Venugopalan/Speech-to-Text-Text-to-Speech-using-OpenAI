Advisor: Good morning, Mr. Kerner. I'm Priya Shah, a certified senior financial advisor at Canoda. I've been working in personal wealth management for over 12 years. How can I assist you today? Client: Good morning, Priya. I'm looking to invest in a Canoda financial product, but I'm not sure what suits me best. Advisor: Of course. Let's begin by understanding your current situation. Could you confirm your full name and date of birth? Client: Sure. My name is James Turner, and I was born on March 5, 1958. Advisor: Thank you. Are you currently employed or retired? Client: I'm retired. I worked as an accountant and retired three years ago. I don't plan to return to work. Advisor: Understood. What are your main sources of income currently? Client: I receive a state pension and a private pension, totaling around £2,800 per month. Advisor: And approximately, how much do you spend each month? Client: Around £1,900 to £2,000. Advisor: Do you have any outstanding mortgages or loans, like for your home or car? Client: No, both my home and vehicle are fully paid off. Advisor: Do you have any financial dependents? Client: Yes, my wife. She's also retired. Advisor: In case of your passing, would you like your investment funds to be transferred to her? Client: Yes, she should be the nominee. Advisor: Thanks for confirming. Based on your profile, I'd recommend reviewing three Canoda financial products. Advisor: First, the Canoda Capital Protected Savings Bond. This product protects your original capital while offering up to 3.5% annual return, depending on market performance. It has a fixed term of five years and is ideal for clients who want minimal risk. Advisor: Second, the Balanced Growth Investment Plan. This is a moderate risk portfolio with investments across equities, bonds, and funds. It has historically delivered annual returns between 5% to 6%, with the past three years averaging around 5.2%. You can access funds flexibly after three years. Advisor: Third, the Flexible Income Fund. It's designed to provide a steady monthly or quarterly payout, with current returns averaging 4.2%. It's best suited for clients seeking regular retirement income. Client: The Balanced Growth Plan sounds like a good balance. I'm okay with some risk for better returns. Advisor: That makes sense. Since your pension covers your monthly needs and you have no major liabilities, the Balanced Growth Plan could help grow your wealth effectively. Advisor: Would you like to proceed with that option? Client: Yes, let's go ahead with the Balanced Growth Plan. Advisor: Perfect. I'll document all the details we discussed today, including your personal and financial profile, nominee preferences, and product selection, and email them to you by the end of the day. Advisor: I'll also arrange a callback in three days, giving you time to review everything and finalize your decision. Client: That sounds good. Thank you, Priya. Advisor: You're very welcome, Mr. Turner. I look forward to speaking with you again soon.
